// In this task we learn about variables and function calls.

//   Variables store information. In Javascript, they're very flexible...sometimes a bit too flexible, as we will discuss later.

//   A variable doesn't need to be declared in Javascript, but it should always be (as we will discuss later)*/

//A variable is declared thus:
var your_variable_name = /*something*/;

/* The variable's name can have letters, numbers (but not as the first character), and underscores. /*something*/ can be a number, 
   text, or more things that we will discuss later. */

// so a variable set to a number on declaration is like this:
var some_variable = 7;
var some_variable_2 = -66543;

// and text looks like this:
var some_other_variable = "This is some text."

// Functions do things, when called. A function call takes some number of parameters, such as variables and things we will discuss later. 
// That number can be zero. It also may or may not return a value that you can assign to a variable.

// Example function call (of a function that takes three parameters): 
sum_dum_goys_function(some_variable, some_variable_2, some_other_variable);
// And then a function call of a function with no parameters:
sum_dim_doks_function();
