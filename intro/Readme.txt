Here's your intro! First, the tools you'll need:

 Download Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) if you're using Windows and don't have something else you'd prefer. 
 
 Download Python 3.0 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) if you don't have another web server you'd want to use.

 If you don't have a browser that supports WebGL 2.0....get a browser that isn't trash. Chromium or Brave are good options.

Open lesson_intro.js with notepad++, and do as it says.
