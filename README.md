# homework
Welcome! This is a series of tasks meant to be a dive into programming. We're going to use almost no tools; just a WebGL capable browser (Chrome family/Brave/Firefox/Safari all work), Python's simple web server, and the word proc of your choice. JavaScript is the language, and we'll be using the Pixi.js library.

 Suggested downloads:

Notepad++ (if you don't have a word proc you prefer)
Brave (if you're still using behind the curve Microsoft stuff that has lagged in supporting WebGL)
